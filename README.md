<h1 align="center">Philosophers</h1>
Philosophers is a 42 school project designed around Edsger Dijkstra's famous dining philosophers problem. For this project, we must learn about concurrent programming. For the project's mandatory part, we must find a solution to the problem using only threads and mutexes. For the bonus part, we must create a second program that uses processes and semaphores.
